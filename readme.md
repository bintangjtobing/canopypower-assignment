## Introductions

Hi :). I'm Bintang, thank you for giving me this opportunity to complete this assignment.
So, i have been completed this task:
- Problem statement: Design a website page which enable users to modify site info or add a new site. Maybe you mean this is the task number 1 which is Design the wireframe for the new page.
- Modify site info
- Add new site
- and others.

## Instructions how to run the code
The first is the database, so I've included SQL files in this repo. You can download it and import it into your SQL software. You can use XAMPP, SQLite, or others.
And the next is:
- You can clone this repo,
- Open this workspace/repo on your Visual Studio Code or you can use notepad++ or others.
- And then open your Terminal, and input cd --downloaded-directory-folder
- Input php artisan serve on your terminal for the backend.
- And the last you can open another tab on your terminal (Command + T).
- Input npm run watch for the frontend, i use vue.js.
- You can see on your browser by localhost:8000. It should be worked because on .env file i set it up to localhost, 127.0.0.1 with port 3306.

Or if you confused and want to see my projects, i have been already set the project on my own hosting.
- You can check it on [canopy.bintangtobing.com](https://canopy.bintangtobing.com).

## How it works?
- You can login it with username: admin, password: canopytest.
- And then you will see the dashboards, and then you can go to Your Sites.
- As your assignment, i've been already completed that, with you can add your website, update it and delete on Account page.

## Thank you
Thank you Canopy Power for giving me the chances! :)
